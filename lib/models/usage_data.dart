        "TDS is an abbreviation for Total Dissolved Solids in a liquid, including organic and inorganic substances in a molecular, ionic, or micro-granular suspended form. TDS is generally expressed in parts per million (ppm) or as milligrams per liter (mg/L). TDS is directly related to the quality of water i.e., the lower a TDS figure, the purer the water. As an example, reverse osmosis purified water will have a TDS between 0 and 10, whereas tap water will vary between 20 and 300, depending on where you live in the world.",
